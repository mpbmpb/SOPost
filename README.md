<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p align="center">

</p>
This is a short console app written as an exercise given in de udemy course C# Intermediate by Mosh Hamedani.
<br/>
<br/>
The app models a forum post with associated properties, as well as a vote counter.
<br/>
As an extra feature I added a method to format the elapsed time since posting and export the post to the console.
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote all of the exercises for this course using the TDD approach of writing tests first and then production code.
The tests are written using xUnit and Fluent Assertions.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Mosh Hamedani for making a comprehensive and easy to follow course. :star:
<br/>

A list of commonly used resources that I found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
The code was written in Visual Studio.<br/>
The test coverage was measured with JetBrains dotCover.

* [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp)
* [xUnit](https://xunit.net)
* [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/)
* [dotCover](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/)

### Specifications
The given specifications were:

* Design a class called Post. This class models a StackOverflow post. 
* It should have properties for title, description and the date/time it was created. 
* We should be able to up-vote or down-vote a post. We should also be able to see the current vote value. 
* In the main method, create a post, up-vote and down-vote it a few times and then display the the current vote value.
